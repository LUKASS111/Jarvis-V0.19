## üõ†Ô∏è **PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS**

### **Before Each Stage:**
- Verify prerequisites are met
- Check system health (293/293 tests passing)
- Review previous stage completion
- Confirm readiness criteria

### **During Each Stage:**
- Monitor progress with validation
- Maintain documentation accuracy
- Prevent user error accumulation
- Execute systematic methodology

### **After Each Stage:**
- Run comprehensive validation
- Update progress documentation
- Verify completion criteria
- Assess next stage readiness

---

## üöÄ **PATH FORWARD**

### **Current Priority:**
1. **Execute Foundation Repair Plan** (highest priority)
2. **Validate foundation completion** (85%+ average)
3. **Execute Stage 6** (GUI validation framework)
4. **Continue systematic progression** (Stages 7-10)

### **Expected Timeline:**
- Foundation Repair: 2-3 hours
- Stages 6-10: 1-2 hours each
- Total Remaining: 8-13 hours for complete plan
