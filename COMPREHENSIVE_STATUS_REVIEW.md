---

## üöÄ **EXECUTION PATHWAYS**

### **Option A: Proceed to Stage 6 (Recommended)**
```bash
@copilot Execute Stage 6 of Systematic Engineering Plan
```
**Rationale:** Foundation exceeds 85% requirement, all critical infrastructure operational

### **Option B: Enhance Stage 3 First (Optional)**
```bash
@copilot Execute Stage 3 quality standards enhancement
```
**Rationale:** Bring Stage 3 from 57.5% to 85%+ for even stronger foundation

### **Professional Commands Available:**
```bash
# Progress monitoring
@copilot Report current foundation status

# Stage execution  
@copilot Execute Stage [N] of Systematic Engineering Plan

# Quality enhancement
@copilot Execute Stage 3 enhancement for quality standards
```
