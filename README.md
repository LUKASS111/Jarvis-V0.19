> **Status**: Production Ready + Autonomous Agent Development | **Tests**: 297/297 Passing | **Version**: v1.0.0 → v2.0.0

## 🎯 Vision: Natural Language to Program Automation

**Tell Jarvis loosely what you want, watch it autonomously make it happen**

*"Build me a 3D medieval castle scene"* → Jarvis autonomously uses Unreal Engine CLI, tries different approaches, learns from errors, persists until success

## 🎯 Quick Start

### GUI Mode (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py --gui
```

### CLI Mode
```bash
python main.py --cli
```

### Backend API
```bash
python main.py --backend
```
