archive_id = archive_input(content="input", source="main", operation="query")
archive_output(content="output", source="llm", operation="response")
stats = get_archive_stats()
```

**Verification**
```python
from jarvis.core import verify_data_immediately

result = verify_data_immediately(content="data", data_type="factual")
print(f"Verified: {result.is_verified}, Confidence: {result.confidence_score}")
```

```python
from jarvis.core import create_backup, restore_from_backup

backup = create_backup("Manual backup")
success = restore_from_backup(backup.backup_id)
```

**CRDT Operations**
```python
from jarvis.core import get_crdt_manager

# Initialize CRDT manager
crdt_manager = get_crdt_manager()

# Counter operations (distributed metrics)
counter = crdt_manager.get_counter("health_metrics")
counter.increment(100)  # Add to health score
print(f"Total health: {counter.value()}")

# Set operations (permanent records)
audit_set = crdt_manager.get_set("audit_log")
audit_set.add("operation_12345")
print(f"Contains operation: {audit_set.contains('operation_12345')}")

# Register operations (latest configuration)
config = crdt_manager.get_register("system_config")
config.write({"debug_mode": True}, "admin_node")
print(f"Current config: {config.read()}")

# Distributed synchronization
sync_result = crdt_manager.sync_with_peers()
print(f"Sync successful: {sync_result.success}")
```
