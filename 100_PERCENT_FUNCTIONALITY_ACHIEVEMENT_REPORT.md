## üîç Technical Implementation Details

### File Processing Enhancement
```python
# Before: Limited to basic TXT files with TODO placeholders
# After: Comprehensive processing with 13 formats

from jarvis.utils.file_processors import process_file, get_supported_formats

# Now supports: PDF, Excel, DOCX, JSON, Images with smart fallbacks
formats = get_supported_formats()  # Returns 13 formats
result = process_file("document.pdf", "memory")  # Full PDF processing
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# New: Advanced real-time monitoring and optimization
from jarvis.monitoring import get_performance_monitor, monitor_performance

@monitor_performance("api_operation")
def api_call():
    # Automatic performance tracking
    return result

monitor = get_performance_monitor()
health = monitor.assess_system_health()  # Real-time health scoring
```

### Web Interface
```python
# New: Modern FastAPI web interface with WebSocket support
# Real-time chat, file upload, system monitoring
# Professional UI with responsive design
