## üö® **CRITICAL FOUNDATION ISSUES**

### **Primary Blockers for Stage 6:**

1. **Legacy Code Burden** (Stage 1 & 5)
   - 2,352+ legacy references identified
   - 783 active legacy references in codebase
   - Target: Zero legacy code remaining

2. **GUI Functionality Gap** (Stage 2 & 5)
   - Current GUI accessibility: 20.4%
   - Target: 90%+ before Stage 6
   - Need: Configuration & Core System interfaces

3. **Validation Infrastructure**
   - Missing individual stage validators
   - Need: Complete validation framework
   - Target: Professional verification system
