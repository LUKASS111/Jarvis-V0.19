## Decision Log

### 2025-01-08 - Production Validation Strategy
- **Author**: Copilot AI Agent
- **Context**: Need to ensure all critical fixes are validated and system is production-ready
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive production validation with explicit critical issue resolution tracking
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Basic functionality testing (rejected - insufficient for production)
  - Automated testing only (rejected - need manual validation for critical issues)
  - Gradual rollout (considered - may implement for major releases)
- **Consequences**: Enhanced confidence in production readiness, clear validation criteria
- **Commit**: [6f22489](https://github.com/LUKASS111/Jarvis-V0.19/commit/6f22489)
