## Decision Log

### 2025-01-08 - 5-Stage Development Framework
- **Author**: Copilot AI Agent
- **Context**: Need systematic approach to repository development with clear milestones and traceability
- **Decision**: Implement 5-stage development framework covering logic analysis, backend consistency, testing, smart GUI, and documentation
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Ad-hoc development (rejected - no traceability)
  - Agile sprints (rejected - not suitable for AI agent workflow)
  - Waterfall approach (rejected - too rigid)
- **Consequences**: Systematic development progress, clear completion criteria, improved documentation
- **Commit**: [ca7408b](https://github.com/LUKASS111/Jarvis-V0.19/commit/ca7408b)
