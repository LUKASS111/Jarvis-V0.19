- **Author**: [Name/Role]
- **Context**: [Why this decision was needed - business/technical background]
- **Decision**: [What was decided]
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - [Option 1] (rejected - reason)
  - [Option 2] (rejected - reason)
  - [Option 3] (considered for future - reason)

## Decision Categories

Use these standardized categories for consistent classification:

### Technical Decisions
- **Architecture**: System design, component structure, patterns
- **Technology**: Language, framework, library choices
- **Performance**: Optimization strategies, scalability approaches
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption decisions

### Process Decisions  
- **Workflow**: Development processes, branching strategies
- **Documentation**: Standards, formats, maintenance approaches
- **Testing**: Strategy, tools, coverage requirements
- **Deployment**: Release processes, environment management

### Business Decisions
- **Features**: Scope, prioritization, user experience
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional specifications
- **Timeline**: Release schedules, milestone planning
- **Resources**: Team allocation, tool procurement

## Decision Review Process

1. **Initial Documentation**: Capture decision when made
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate outcomes after implementation
3. **Lessons Learned**: Document what worked well and what didn't
4. **Archive Process**: Move superseded decisions to archive with cross-references

## Quality Guidelines

- **Be Specific**: Include concrete technical details and reasoning
- **Include Context**: Explain the situation that required the decision
- **Document Alternatives**: Show other options were considered
- **Link Implementation**: Connect decision to actual code/configuration changes
- **Update Status**: Mark decisions as implemented, modified, or superseded
