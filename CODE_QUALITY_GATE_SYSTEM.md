### 5. Performance Quality Gates

#### Performance Benchmarks
- **Response Time**: API response time targets (<200ms for critical operations)
- **Throughput**: System throughput requirements (minimum operations/second)
- **Resource Usage**: Memory and CPU usage limits
- **Scalability**: Multi-node performance validation

#### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: System behavior under normal load
- **Stress Testing**: System behavior under extreme load
- **Endurance Testing**: System behavior over extended periods
- **Spike Testing**: System behavior under sudden load spikes

### 6. Documentation Quality Gates

#### Documentation Requirements
- **API Documentation**: Complete API documentation with examples
- **Architecture Documentation**: System architecture diagrams and descriptions
- **User Documentation**: End-user guides and tutorials
- **Developer Documentation**: Development setup and contribution guides

#### Documentation Quality
- **Accuracy**: Documentation matches actual implementation
- **Completeness**: All features and components documented
- **Clarity**: Clear and understandable documentation
- **Currency**: Documentation kept up-to-date with changes

## Quality Gate Implementation

### Automated Checks

#### Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
# Code formatting
black --check .
isort --check-only .

# Code quality
flake8 .
pylint jarvis/

# Security
bandit -r jarvis/
safety check

# Tests
python -m pytest --cov=jarvis --cov-report=term-missing
```

#### Continuous Integration Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - code_quality
  - security_scan
  - test_execution
  - performance_test
  - documentation_build
  - deployment_validation
```

#### Quality Metrics Dashboard
- Real-time quality metrics visualization
- Trend analysis and historical tracking
- Quality gate pass/fail status
- Improvement recommendations

### Quality Gate Enforcement

#### Blocking Criteria
Any of the following conditions will block deployment:
- Unit test coverage below 85%
- Critical security vulnerabilities detected
- Performance regression >20%
- Architecture compliance violations
- Documentation coverage below 80%

#### Warning Criteria
The following conditions generate warnings but don't block:
- Code complexity above target thresholds
- Minor security issues
- Performance regression 5-20%
- Non-critical documentation gaps

### Quality Improvement Process

#### Continuous Improvement Cycle
1. **Measure**: Collect quality metrics
2. **Analyze**: Identify improvement opportunities
3. **Improve**: Implement quality improvements
4. **Monitor**: Track improvement effectiveness

#### Quality Reviews
- **Weekly Quality Reports**: Automated quality metric summaries
- **Monthly Quality Reviews**: Team review of quality trends
- **Quarterly Architecture Reviews**: Comprehensive architecture assessment
- **Annual Quality Audits**: External quality assessment
