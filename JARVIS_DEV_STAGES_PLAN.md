# Jarvis AI Assistant â€“ Development Stages Plan (with .md File Versioning)

**Purpose:**  
This document tracks all main development stages and their mapping to corresponding documentation files (.md) in the repository.  
**Every completed stage must reference the updated .md file and its version/section.**  
This ensures traceability, prevents confusion, and keeps all changes auditable.

## Stage Details

### 1. Program Logic & Know How âœ… **COMPLETE**
- [x] Create development stages plan document
- [x] Scan codebase for main loops, decision points, test gates, and version logging
- [x] Analyze main.py entry point and argument parsing logic
- [x] Map jarvis/ core module architecture and data flow
- [x] Document gui/ interface components and interaction patterns
- [x] Create comprehensive `PROGRAM_LOGIC_KNOW_HOW.md` with current logic skeleton and version info
- [x] Update stage status to completed

### 2. Backend Consistency âœ… **COMPLETE**
- [x] Audit backend output for identical signal flow to GUI & CLI
- [x] Map all backend API endpoints and data interfaces
- [x] Verify consistency between CLI commands and GUI actions
- [x] Update/extend `BACKEND_SIGNALS.md` and reference changes in `PROGRAM_LOGIC_KNOW_HOW.md`

### 3. Error-Proof Testing & Logging âœ… **COMPLETE**
- [x] Expand backend and Python GUI autotests
- [x] Create comprehensive test coverage analysis
- [x] Implement advanced logging and monitoring systems
- [x] Log all updates with version in `TESTS_AND_LOGGING.md` and update logic references in other .md files

### 4. Smart Python GUI & AI Orchestration âœ… **COMPLETE**
- [x] Design unified dashboard layout, integrate backend AI orchestration
- [x] Implement adaptive UI components based on user behavior
- [x] Create intelligent AI model selection and orchestration
- [x] Implement user behavior tracking and analytics
- [x] Create adaptive tab management system
- [x] Build AI provider performance monitoring
- [x] Implement intelligent status widgets with predictive insights
- [x] Document architecture and version in `SMART_GUI_AI_ORCHESTRATION_PLAN.md`
- [x] Validate smart features with comprehensive testing

### 5. README + .md Synchronization âœ… **COMPLETE**
- [x] Update README to reference this plan and all relevant .md files
- [x] Link to each stage's .md documentation with clear navigation
- [x] Maintain changelog of completed stages and version updates
- [x] Ensure all documentation versions are synchronized across all files
- [x] Add comprehensive development documentation section
- [x] Document smart GUI features and testing capabilities
- [x] Create complete traceability from development plan to implementation

## Versioning & Documentation Rules

- **Each time a stage is started or completed, record the version/section in the related .md file.**
- **Every logic change, architectural refactor, or new test must be referenced in the correct .md file.**
- **README must always link to this plan and mention latest .md file versions for full project traceability.**

---

## Current Progress Summary

**Active Stage**: ðŸŽ‰ **ALL STAGES COMPLETE**  
**Progress**: 5/5 Stages Complete (100%) - Full development framework implemented  
**Completed**: Program logic analysis, backend consistency, professional testing, smart GUI with AI orchestration, comprehensive documentation synchronization  
**Status**: Ready for advanced feature development and continued enhancement  

---

**Always update this plan and relevant .md files as work progresses.  
Every change and version must be traceable from plan â†’ documentation â†’ code.**

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-08 - 5-Stage Development Framework
- **Author**: Copilot AI Agent
- **Context**: Need systematic approach to repository development with clear milestones and traceability
- **Decision**: Implement 5-stage development framework covering logic analysis, backend consistency, testing, smart GUI, and documentation
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Ad-hoc development (rejected - no traceability)
  - Agile sprints (rejected - not suitable for AI agent workflow)
  - Waterfall approach (rejected - too rigid)
- **Consequences**: Systematic development progress, clear completion criteria, improved documentation
- **Commit**: [ca7408b](https://github.com/LUKASS111/Jarvis-V0.19/commit/ca7408b)
