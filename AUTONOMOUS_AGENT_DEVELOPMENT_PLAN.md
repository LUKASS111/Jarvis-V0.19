# ü§ñ Jarvis Autonomous Agent Development Plan

**Status:** `ACTIVE` | **Version:** v2.0.0 | **Last Updated:** 2025-01-08

## üéØ Vision: Natural Language to Program Automation

Transform Jarvis into an autonomous AI agent capable of interpreting natural language commands and autonomously executing complex program interactions with infinite persistence and learning capabilities.

### Core Objective
**Enable users to loosely tell Jarvis**: *"Build me a 3D scene with a castle"*
**Jarvis autonomously**: Uses Unreal Engine CLI, tries different approaches, learns from errors, persists until success

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture for Autonomous Capabilities

### Phase A: Natural Language Command Interpretation (v2.1.0)

#### A1: Command Parser & Intent Recognition
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/command_interpreter.py
class NaturalLanguageCommandParser:
    """Convert natural language to structured action plans"""
    
    def parse_command(self, user_input: str) -> ActionPlan:
        # Multi-LLM analysis for intent extraction
        # Break down complex commands into executable steps
        # Identify target programs and required interactions
        
    def generate_action_plan(self, intent: Intent) -> List[ProgramAction]:
        # Create step-by-step execution plan
        # Include fallback strategies and error handling
```

#### A2: Program Registry & Interface Abstraction
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/program_registry.py
class ProgramRegistry:
    """Registry of available programs and their interaction methods"""
    
    programs = {
        'unreal_engine': UnrealEngineInterface(),
        'blender': BlenderInterface(), 
        'git': GitInterface(),
        'docker': DockerInterface(),
        'npm': NPMInterface(),
        # ... extensible registry
    }
```

#### A3: Multi-LLM Orchestration for Analysis
- **Primary LLM**: Command interpretation and planning
- **Specialist LLMs**: Domain-specific analysis (3D graphics, code generation, etc.)
- **Validation LLM**: Error analysis and alternative strategy generation

### Phase B: Program Interaction Framework (v2.2.0)

#### B1: Universal Program Interface
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/program_interfaces/base.py
class ProgramInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract base for all program interactions"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def execute_command(self, command: str) -> ExecutionResult:
        """Execute command with full capture of output/errors"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze_output(self, result: ExecutionResult) -> AnalysisResult:
        """Determine if execution was successful and extract insights"""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_alternatives(self, failed_result: ExecutionResult) -> List[str]:
        """Generate alternative approaches when command fails"""
```

#### B2: Execution Engine with Persistence
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/execution_engine.py
class PersistentExecutionEngine:
    """Execute commands with infinite retry logic and learning"""
    
    def execute_with_persistence(self, action_plan: ActionPlan) -> FinalResult:
        attempts = 0
        max_attempts = user_config.get('max_attempts', float('inf'))
        
        while attempts < max_attempts:
            try:
                result = self.execute_step(action_plan.current_step)
                if result.success:
                    self.learn_from_success(result)
                    action_plan.advance()
                    if action_plan.complete:
                        return FinalResult.success(result)
                else:
                    alternative_strategies = self.generate_alternatives(result)
                    action_plan.update_with_alternatives(alternative_strategies)
                    
            except Exception as e:
                self.learn_from_error(e)
                alternative_strategies = self.analyze_exception(e)
                action_plan.update_with_alternatives(alternative_strategies)
                
            attempts += 1
            
        return FinalResult.partial_success_with_learnings()
```

#### B3: Learning and Memory System
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/learning_engine.py
class AutonomousLearningEngine:
    """Learn from successes and failures to improve future performance"""
    
    def learn_from_success(self, successful_execution: ExecutionResult):
        # Store successful command patterns
        # Update confidence scores for similar future commands
        # Build knowledge base of working solutions
        
    def learn_from_failure(self, failed_execution: ExecutionResult):
        # Analyze failure patterns
        # Update error prediction models
        # Generate improved alternative strategies
        
    def suggest_improvements(self, command_pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        # Use historical data to suggest optimizations
        # Predict potential issues before execution
```

### Phase C: Advanced Autonomous Capabilities (v2.3.0)

#### C1: Multi-Program Orchestration
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/multi_program_orchestrator.py
class MultiProgramOrchestrator:
    """Coordinate complex workflows across multiple programs"""
    
    def execute_complex_workflow(self, workflow: WorkflowPlan):
        # Coordinate between Unreal Engine, Blender, Git, etc.
        # Handle data flow between programs
        # Manage dependencies and execution order
        
    def optimize_program_selection(self, task: Task) -> ProgramSelection:
        # Intelligently choose best tools for the job
        # Consider performance, capabilities, user preferences
```

#### C2: Real-time Adaptation and Recovery
```python
# jarvis/autonomous/adaptive_recovery.py
class AdaptiveRecoverySystem:
    """Real-time adaptation when programs behave unexpectedly"""
    
    def monitor_execution(self, process: Process) -> MonitoringData:
        # Real-time monitoring of external program execution
        # Detect hanging processes, unexpected outputs, etc.
        
    def adaptive_intervention(self, issue: ExecutionIssue) -> InterventionStrategy:
        # Dynamically adjust strategy based on real-time feedback
        # Kill and restart processes, modify parameters, try alternatives
```

## Notes

This plan builds directly on Jarvis's current stable foundation (297/297 tests passing, all systems operational) to add autonomous capabilities. The approach is designed to be maintainable by AI assistants like Copilot through:

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Each autonomous capability fully tested
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent with existing 5-file structure
- **Gradual Implementation**: Phased approach building on proven components
- **Safety Integration**: Built-in controls and monitoring

The system will enable true natural language to program automation while maintaining the professional standards and reliability of the current Jarvis platform.
