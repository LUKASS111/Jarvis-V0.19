## Modularity Assessment

### ‚úÖ Well-Structured Components (Appropriate Modularity)
- **Core System**: `data_archiver.py`, `data_verifier.py`, `backup_recovery.py`
  - Single responsibility, appropriate size (500-600 lines)
  - Clear interfaces, minimal coupling
  
- **CRDT Implementation**: Distributed across multiple focused files
  - `crdt_manager.py`, `crdt_network.py`, `crdt_conflict_resolver.py`
  - Each handles specific CRDT aspects, good separation
  
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Well-organized test suites
  - Comprehensive coverage across multiple test files
  - Each test file focused on specific functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Potential Optimization

#### 1. Documentation Generator (1,686 lines)
**Current**: Single large file handling all documentation generation
**Analysis**: Could be split but may not be necessary
- Handles multiple document types (API, guides, diagrams)
- Has natural internal structure by document type
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is unless specific maintenance issues arise
- **Rationale**: Documentation generation is inherently complex; splitting could reduce cohesion

#### 2. Agent Workflow (1,147 lines)
**Current**: Comprehensive agent management system
**Analysis**: Well-structured despite size
- Clear separation of concerns within the file
- Complex domain requires comprehensive handling
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is
- **Rationale**: Agent workflow is a cohesive domain; splitting would create artificial boundaries

### ‚úÖ Distributed Testing (860 lines)
**Current**: Complete distributed testing framework
**Analysis**: Appropriate size for complexity
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is
- **Rationale**: Distributed testing requires comprehensive scenarios; size is justified

## Directory Structure Analysis
