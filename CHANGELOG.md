## [0.19.1] - 2025-07-28 (Repository Restructuring)

### Changed
- **üèóÔ∏è Major Repository Restructuring**: Complete reorganization for improved maintainability
  - Moved core modules to `jarvis/` package structure
  - Separated GUI components into `gui/` directory
  - Organized tests by type in `tests/` subdirectories
  - Created dedicated directories for scripts, docs, config, and data
  - Added proper `__init__.py` files for all Python packages

- **üìÅ New Directory Structure**:
  ```
  jarvis/core/         # Main application logic (main.py, error_handler.py)
  jarvis/llm/          # LLM interface modules
  jarvis/memory/       # Memory management system
  jarvis/utils/        # Utility modules (logs.py)
  gui/                 # GUI components (modern_gui.py)
  tests/unit/          # Unit tests
  tests/integration/   # Integration tests
  tests/regression/    # Regression tests
  tests/performance/   # Performance tests
  tests/functional/    # Functional tests
  scripts/             # Development tools and automation
  docs/                # Documentation
  config/              # Configuration files
  data/                # Application data and exports
  ```

- **üîß Updated Import System**: All imports updated to use new modular structure
  - Tests updated to import from new package locations
  - Maintained backward compatibility through main.py facade
  - Updated all cross-module references
